        <p>I have a number of varied hobbies. I enjoy mostly things outdoors and playing my guitar. I enjoy camping, hiking, and just being out there.
        I look forward to having a job where I can combine my interests in medicine and technology. I want to work in an environment where people take pride in their work.
        Looking forward to what the future holds for me! Always excited to take on new challenges and learn to be better along the way!</p>

        <h3>Sample Of a Song</h3>
        <p>Here is a song that I was working on prior to getting into coding. I love music and think it is a great way to connect with others.
        I look forward to being able to make more music in the future!</p>
