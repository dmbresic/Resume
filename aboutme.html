    <p>Hello all that have come to view my webpage! I have started this journey and figured this would be a good way to get started on this long journey!<br>
    I wanted to find a way that I could introduce myself on a few differnt pages and I figured this would be the best way to do that. I am so excited to be doing this!<br>
    My father introduced me to computers at the age of thirteen and I was simply enamored by them, I loved playing video games growing up and spent countless hours<br>
    online playing games. I did end up going to school for medicine initially because I didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life quite yet. But, as things<br>
    go, I was offered the oppurtunity to change. I saw my chance and I decided to run with it, I am a student of Software Engineering currently. I am familiar with<br>
    HTML, CSS, and Java. I have worked with some Python in the past, but look forward to exploring JavaScript and other languages to see what is offered. Over time<br>
    I plan to become proficient at coding and make a career out of this large and expansive field.<br>
        <br>

    Thank you for visiting my first webpage! I plan to make updates as I get more advanced with my capabilites!
